Introduction:
The TaskScheduling application is a Java console program that uses a Min-Heap data structure to manage tasks based on their wait times. Tasks with shorter wait times are prioritized and processed first, simulating a priority queue. This is useful in environments like customer service or job scheduling.

Features:
Add Task: Adds a task with a description and a wait time to the heap.
View Next Task: Displays the task with the shortest wait time without removing it.
Remove Next Task: Removes and processes the task with the shortest wait time.
Display All Tasks: Lists all tasks sorted by wait time.
Exit: Closes the application.


Purpose:
This application was created to demonstrate the use of the Min-Heap data structure and to simulate a priority-driven task scheduler. The goal is to manage tasks efficiently by prioritizing those with shorter wait times, a common requirement in real-time systems like customer support or job scheduling.

Contribution:
Learning: Deepens understanding of heap data structures and priority queues.
Real-World Application: Can be applied to areas like customer support queues, job schedulers, or emergency response systems.
Efficiency: Provides a fast and efficient way to manage tasks, with operations (add, remove, view) optimized using heap properties.
